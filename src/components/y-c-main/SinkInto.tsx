            <span> They Have Impressive Vision </span> For colorblind creatures,
            cuttlefish have remarkable vision. They have the ability to perceive
            polarized light, which provides them with an enhanced capacity to
            detect prey.

            <span> Cuttlefish Change Color To Match Their Surroundings </span>
            In order to blend in with their environment, cuttlefish can change
            their skin color in a flash â€” in less than one second.
          </li>

            <span>They Can Count </span> Cuttlefish are known for their
            intelligence, and when it comes to counting shrimp, they truly
            shine. A study found that one-month-old cuttlefish could easily tell
            the difference between a box with four shrimp and a box with five
            shrimp.
